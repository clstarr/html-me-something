                      Back in 2012 I was deployed in the Air Force jointly with the 
                      Army to work the R & R program. The R & R program basically stood for 
                      "Rest and Relaxation". The Army's standard deployment use to be 12 months 
                      with 2 weeks of R & R at the halfway point. My job was to work with the Army team
                      at Camp LSA in Kuwait and help with the manifestation of our military members, sending
                      them back home to the states for 2 weeks. I was deployed in Kuwait for 6 months, and while I was
                      there I was able to visit the city of Kuwait and tour their historic monuments.

                    My second deployment was in 2015 with A PERSCO group in the Air Force. <abbr title="Personnel Support for Contingency Operations">PERSCO</abbr> stands for Personnel Support for 
                    Contingency Operations. My job was to play a role in the accountability process for inbound and outbound military members
                    who were coming to Qatar for deployment or passing through. While I was deployed, I was able to get off base and travel
                    to Doha, which is Qatar's major city. It was absolutely beautiful and the food was amazing. The city had a lot of stores to 
                    shop at and places to eat. The mall was incredibly huge, and the did I mention the food?

                       In 2017 I took a trip to visit friends in the Air Force stationed at Ramstein, Germany. I was there for leisure and it was
                       one of the most exciting trips I've taken. Germany is a beautiful country richly filled with culture. The old churches still 
                       stand and the castles are an absolute sight to see! The beer is absolutely delicious, and the food was very good as well. The locals
                       were very nice, and even though I didnt speak German, everyone was patient with me and helpful when I would lose my way or needed help
                       with directions.

                   <p>
                       I also visited London in 2017 once again visiting military friends who were stationed at an Air Force base not far from London. 
                       The first time I ever walked down the street in between "Big Ben" and the famous "London Eye", it was absolutely sureal. I couldn't
                       believe I was there. I remember watching movies that were based in England, and London would be a part of the scenes in the movie. Yet, 
                       here I was... Finally standing in front of Big Ben! The city is so lively, and during the afternoon hours, the sunsets and lights up
                       the entire city in soft orange, yellow and lavender hues. I would love to go back to London again one of these days.

                   <h2>Japan</h2>
                   <p>
                       I saved the best for last. Japan. In 2014 I traveled to Japan, visiting military friends. I cannot begin to describe just how
                       beautiful Japan is. There is so much to do and see there, with ancient landscapes that have been preserved and incredible busy cities 
                       to tour around, Japan is a place I fell in love with. Once you arrive to Japan, the first thing you notice are the shops and all of
                       the places to eat. Each restaurant will have a display of everything they have on their menu. The display is a model to show you what you're ordering,
                       but it looks EXACTLY like the meal you order. One of the locations I visited while in Japan was a place called the Bamboo Forest located in Kyoto Japan.
                       It's an enormous area with bamboo that reaches far into the sky. There were small areas of gardens while you tour around the forest that 
                       almost seemed like a photo in a fairytale book. Japan is certainly magical and the people there are incredibly kind and friendly. I would love to go 
                       back to Japan, and enjoy the wonderful culture there.
